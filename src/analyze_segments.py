'''This script performs multimodal understanding of a video over time.

Step 1 — The video is split into small time segments (2 seconds each).

Step 2 — For each segment:
    • A few frames are extracted → Vision model describes what is happening.
    • Audio is analyzed:
        - Speech is transcribed (what was said).
        - Environmental sounds are detected using PANNs (real audio classification).

Step 3 — The system creates a time-aligned timeline:
    For every moment → it knows:
        - What was seen
        - What was spoken
        - What sounds were present

Step 4 — The full timeline is saved as timeline.json,
which can later be queried (e.g., "When did horses appear?").

In simple terms:
Video + Speech + Environmental Sound → Structured timeline of events over time.'''
